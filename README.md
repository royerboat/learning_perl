This is my repository for going through the O'reilly book Learning Perl.

I plan on going on a chapter by chapter basis and completing the exercises and posting them here.

Yes, I know the solutions to the exercises are available in the back of the book and probably online as well. I am coming up with my own solutions to the exercises so I can get some practice.
